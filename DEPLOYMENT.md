# Vercel Deployment Instructions

## Ready for Deployment ✅

Your CommunityHub application is now properly configured for Vercel deployment with a clean repository structure.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Removed server files** - Eliminated backend code and server folder
2. **Cleaned repository structure** - Removed old client folder and duplicate configuration files  
3. **Moved frontend to root** - All React app files are now at the root level for proper Vercel detection
4. **Added vercel.json** - Configured for single-page application routing
5. **Production build ready** - Built and optimized assets in `dist/` folder

## Current Structure

```
/
├── src/                 # React source code
├── dist/               # Built production files
├── package.json        # Dependencies and build scripts
├── vercel.json         # Vercel deployment config
├── vite.config.ts      # Vite build configuration
